# liri-node-app
Week 10 HW

Description: 
In this assignment, I made LIRI. LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

liri.js can take in any one of the following commands:

my-tweets
spotify-this-song
movie-this
do-what-it-says
